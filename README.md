# MDES2409-Master-Repo
This is the master repo for all of the code for the robot for ECE MDE Project S24-09.

Everyone do their individual work and testing in their own branches, or on the branch for that task, 
and leave the main branch for code that has been tested and is ready to go on the robot.


Since this is an organization, you can also make separate repos for certain things as part of this organization if you want.
